# Prediction-of-Alzheimers-disease-using-ML
ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells degenerate and die. Alzheimer’s is an irreversible disease and it can slowly cause impairment in memory and cognitive function.

WHY DO WE NEED A PREDICTIVE MODEL? 
It is a tedious job to diagnose this in its early stage and very expensive as we need a vast volume of data, prediction software and a highly skilled doctor. Present Alzheimer's disease(AD) diagnosis is primarily based on cognitive assessment and recording mental deterioration through a series of standardized assessments as well as subjective examination by the clinician. Hence we need a predictive model that ease the treatment.
