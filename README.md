Early detection of dementia and its type is hard to predict through the traditional approach. Machine Learning plays a crucial role in the field of neurodegenerative disorders as it helps to understand the underlying patterns and relations to provide the right care and support. Dementia is an emerging health issue in developing countries. An early and accurate diagnosis can contribute to more effective treatment. Various Machine Learning Algorithms i.e. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes (NB) were used.

#WHY DO WE NEED A PREDICTIVE MODEL?

The specialist must understand the pattern of lack of skill, history of the patient and cognitive functions of the brain to identify the cause of dementia. Predicting the exact cause of dementia based on its progression can take up to a year. Machine learning models can identify based on their history and helps in timely diagnosis..
